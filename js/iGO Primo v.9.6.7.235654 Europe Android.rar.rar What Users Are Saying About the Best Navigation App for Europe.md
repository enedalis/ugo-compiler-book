2. Extract the files using a file manager app. You should get files with the same extensions as above.
3. Copy the files to the corresponding folders in the iGO folder on your device. For example, copy the .fbl files to the map folder, the .poi files to the poi folder, etc.
4. Delete or rename the old files with the same name as the new ones. For example, delete or rename Europe\_NQ\_2012.Q1\_120508.fbl if you have a new file named Europe\_NQ\_2013.Q1\_130306.fbl.
5. Launch the app and check if the new maps and content are working properly.
