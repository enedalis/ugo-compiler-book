However, when he sees her in danger, he does not hesitate to rescue her. He tells her that she reminds him of his mother, who died protecting him from Mundus. He asks her to stay behind while he goes to face Mundus alone. But as he reaches the final showdown with the Demon Emperor, he finds Trish in his way. She was part of Mundus's plan to weaken Dante's resolve and make him vulnerable. Mundus attacks Trish with a powerful blast, but Dante shields her with his body and gets wounded.
