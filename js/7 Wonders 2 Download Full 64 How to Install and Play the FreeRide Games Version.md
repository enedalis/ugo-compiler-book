## What is 7 Wonders 2?
 
7 Wonders 2 is a match-3 puzzle game that transports you back in time to help workers construct world-famous buildings, monuments and structures, such as Stonehenge, the Great Wall of China, Angkor Wat and the Shwedagon Pagoda. You have to swap adjacent runes on a grid to make sets of three or more runes, which will break into stones that fall into the waiting arms of workers below. The workers will then use them to construct the wonders.
 
The game features exciting power-ups and bonuses that can be earned along the way to help clear the board, maneuver an essential cornerstone to the bottom of the grid and receive pieces of a hidden map, which will ultimately uncover a secret route. The game also has beautiful graphics and captivating music that will immerse you in the ancient world.
