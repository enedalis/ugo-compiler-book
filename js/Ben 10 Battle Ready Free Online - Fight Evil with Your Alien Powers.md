## Ben 10: Battle Ready - Tips and Tricks for Playing Like a Pro
 
If you want to master Ben 10: Battle Ready and defeat Vilgax's ultimate robot, you will need some tips and tricks to help you along the way. Here are some of them:

- Use the right alien for the right situation. Each alien has its own strengths and weaknesses, so you should choose wisely depending on the enemies and obstacles you face. For example, Wildmutt is good for dashing through enemies and avoiding lasers, Four Arms is good for smashing robots and crates, XLR8 is good for speed and agility, Grey Matter is good for solving puzzles and hacking terminals, Upgrade is good for shooting enemies from a distance and upgrading machines, Ripjaws is good for swimming underwater and biting enemies, Stinkfly is good for flying and shooting goo balls, Ghostfreak is good for phasing through walls and tentacle attacks, Heatblast is good for fireballs and melting ice, and Diamondhead is good for diamond projectiles and deflecting lasers.
- Collect energy and Sumo Slammer cards. Energy will increase your health and allow you to survive longer. Sumo Slammer cards will complete your missions and unlock new alien forms and power-ups. You can find them scattered around the warehouse floor or hidden in crates and machines. Some of them are only accessible by certain aliens, so be on the lookout for clues.
- Switch between aliens frequently. You can switch between different alien forms at any time by pressing the spacebar, but be careful not to run out of Omnitrix energy. Switching between aliens will allow you to use different abilities and strategies, as well as avoid getting bored of playing as the same alien. You can also switch back to Ben by pressing X, but this will make you more vulnerable to attacks.
- Watch out for Vilgax's Mechadroids. Vilgax's Mechadroids are his robotic minions that will try to stop you from reaching the Omnitrix. They come in different shapes and sizes, such as spiders, drones, tanks, turrets, walkers and more. They have different weapons and attacks, such as lasers, missiles, bombs, claws and more. They will also get stronger and smarter as you progress through the game. You will need to use your alien powers to defeat them or avoid them.
- Practice your skills in the training missions. Before you face Vilgax's ultimate robot, you will need to complete ten training missions that will teach you how to use each alien form effectively. These missions are located in computer terminals where Gwen will give you instructions and objectives. You will have to complete these missions as a certain alien without turning back to Ben. These missions will help you master your alien powers and prepare you for the final battle.

With these tips and tricks, you will be able to play Ben 10: Battle Ready like a pro and save the world from Vilgax's evil plans. Good luck!
