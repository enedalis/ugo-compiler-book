## Who is Imam Shawkani?
  
Imam Shawkani was a prominent scholar and reformer who lived in Yemen in the 18th and 19th centuries. He was born in a village called Shawkan, hence his name. He studied various Islamic sciences under his father and other eminent teachers. He became the chief judge and mufti of the Zaidi state of Yemen. He was also a prolific writer who authored more than 200 books on various topics, such as Quranic exegesis, hadith, jurisprudence, theology, history, and biography.
  
Imam Shawkani was known for his independent and critical approach to Islamic scholarship. He rejected blind imitation (taqlid) of any school of thought (madhhab) and advocated for the direct reliance on the Quran and the Sunnah (the authentic hadiths). He also opposed many traditional practices and beliefs that he considered to be innovations (bid'ah) or superstitions. He was influenced by the Salafi movement that emerged in Saudi Arabia and Egypt in his time.
  
Imam Shawkani faced many challenges and oppositions from his contemporaries who accused him of deviating from the mainstream Sunni orthodoxy. He was also persecuted by the Ottoman authorities who tried to invade Yemen several times. He died in 1250 AH (1834 CE) in Sana'a, the capital of Yemen.
  
## What is Nayl Al Awtar?
  
Nayl Al Awtar is one of Imam Shawkani's most famous and influential works. It is a commentary on another hadith collection called Bulugh Al Maram (The Attainment of the Objective) by Imam Ibn Hajar Al Asqalani (d. 852 AH). Bulugh Al Maram contains about 1,600 hadiths that are related to Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh). It covers various topics such as purification, prayer, fasting, zakat, hajj, marriage, divorce, inheritance, jihad, oaths, vows, etc.
  
Imam Shawkani expanded on Bulugh Al Maram by adding more than 6,000 hadiths from various sources, such as Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawud, Tirmidhi, Nasa'i, Ibn Majah, etc. He also provided detailed explanations and analyses of the hadiths based on his own understanding and reasoning. He compared and contrasted the opinions of different schools of thought and jurists. He also highlighted the relevant Quranic verses and linguistic aspects of the hadiths.
