## Step 1: Download the Pes 2013 Turkish Commentary Patch
 
The first thing you need to do is to download the Pes 2013 Turkish commentary patch from a reliable source. There are many websites that offer this patch, but some of them may contain viruses or malware that can harm your computer. We recommend you to use this link: [https://www.pes-patch.com/pes-2013-turkish-commentary.html](https://www.pes-patch.com/pes-2013-turkish-commentary.html). This website is safe and trusted by many Pes fans.
 
Once you click on the link, you will see a page with a download button. Click on it and wait for the patch to be downloaded. The file size is about 500 MB, so it may take some time depending on your internet speed.
 
## Step 2: Extract the Pes 2013 Turkish Commentary Patch
 
After the download is complete, you will need to extract the patch from the zip file. To do this, you will need a program that can unzip files, such as WinRAR or 7-Zip. You can download them for free from their official websites: [https://www.win-rar.com/download.html](https://www.win-rar.com/download.html) or [https://www.7-zip.org/download.html](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html).
 
Once you have installed one of these programs, right-click on the zip file and choose "Extract Here" or "Extract to Pes 2013 Turkish Commentary". This will create a folder with the same name as the zip file in the same location. Open the folder and you will see two files: dt00\_t.img and dt05\_t.img. These are the files that contain the Turkish commentary.
 
## Step 3: Copy the Pes 2013 Turkish Commentary Patch Files
 
The next step is to copy these two files to the folder where you have installed Pes 2013 on your PC. The default location is C:\Program Files (x86)\KONAMI\Pro Evolution Soccer 2013\img. If you have changed the installation directory, you will need to find it yourself.
 
To copy the files, select them and press Ctrl+C on your keyboard. Then go to the img folder of Pes 2013 and press Ctrl+V on your keyboard. This will paste the files and overwrite the existing ones. If you are asked to confirm the replacement, click "Yes".
