## Key Features and Benefits of VRED Professional 2019
 
VRED Professional 2019 has many features and benefits that make it a powerful tool for 3D visualization and VR. Here are some of them:
 
- **Data preparation and scene handling:** You can import 3D data from various sources such as Alias, Maya, CATIA, Creo, NX, SolidWorks, and more. You can also optimize your data for visualization purposes, such as reducing polygon count, simplifying geometry, and repairing normals. You can also organize your scene with layers, variants, and animation sets[^1^].
- **Material and lighting:** You can apply realistic materials to your models using the built-in material library or creating your own custom materials. You can also use the Material Editor to adjust various parameters such as color, texture, reflection, refraction, bump, displacement, and more. You can also use the Light Editor to create and edit different types of lights such as point lights, spot lights, area lights, dome lights, and more. You can also use HDR images for image-based lighting[^1^].
- **Rendering and output:** You can use the Render Queue to render multiple images or videos with different settings and resolutions. You can also use the Render Settings to adjust various options such as anti-aliasing, ray tracing, global illumination, ambient occlusion, depth of field, motion blur, and more. You can also use the Render Layers to separate different elements of your scene such as geometry, shadows, reflections, etc. for post-processing purposes[^1^].
- **Interaction and VR:** You can use the Interaction Module to create interactive behaviors for your models such as buttons, switches, sliders, etc. You can also use the Scripting Module to write custom scripts using Python or C# to control your scene logic. You can also use the VR Module to create immersive VR experiences using devices such as HTC Vive or Oculus Rift. You can also use the Collaboration Module to share your scene with others online and communicate via voice chat[^2^].
- **Substance Material Support:** VRED Professional 2019 supports the Substance Engine in both CPU and GPU mode. In GPU mode, texture resolutions up to 8K are possible. Presets created in Substance Designer can be imported, and it is possible to create new, delete, and export presets inside VRED[^3^].
- **Cutout Transparency for OGL:** VRED Professional 2019 has an additional checkbox to the material texture properties for cutout transparent areas of textures in OGL. Objects like foliage, vegetation, or grates will cast shadows more realistically[^3^].
- **Alias Switch Material Support:** VRED Professional 2019 supports Alias Switch Materials when importing Alias .wire files[^3^].
- **AI GPU Denoise:** VRED Professional 2019 uses NvidiaÂ´s OptiX GPU-accelerated AI technology to dramatically reduce render time for a visually noiseless image and provide fast interactive feedback to artists. It is possible to combine CPU raytracing with GPU denoising by enabling it through Render Settings > General Settings > Antialiasing > Denoiser[^3^].
