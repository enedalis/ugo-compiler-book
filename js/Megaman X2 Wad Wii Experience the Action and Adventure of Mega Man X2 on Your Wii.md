# How to Inject Megaman X2 into a Wii VC WAD
 
Megaman X2 is a classic SNES game that features the blue bomber and his allies in a futuristic setting. It is one of the most popular and acclaimed games in the Megaman franchise, and many fans would love to play it on their Wii consoles. However, there is no official Wii VC release of Megaman X2, so the only way to enjoy it is to inject it into an existing SNES WAD.
 
A WAD is a file format that contains data for Wii channels, such as games, emulators, or homebrew applications. By injecting a SNES ROM into a SNES WAD, you can create a custom channel that runs the game on your Wii. However, this process requires some tools and knowledge, and it can also be risky if done incorrectly. Therefore, you should always follow the instructions carefully and have some brick protection on your Wii, such as BootMii or Priiloader.

In this article, we will show you how to inject Megaman X2 into a Wii VC WAD using two different methods: Devilken's VC Injector and AutoInjectuWAD Injector. Both methods require a SNES ROM of Megaman X2 in .smc or .sfc format, a SNES WAD to inject into (we recommend Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest), and a PC with Windows OS.
 
## Method 1: Devilken's VC Injector
 
Devilken's VC Injector is a command-line tool that allows you to inject SNES ROMs into SNES WADs. It supports most SNES games, except those that use LZH8 compression, such as Megaman X3. To use this method, follow these steps:
 
1. Download Devilken's VC Injector from [here](https://gbatemp.net/download/all-in-one-wii-vc-injecting-tools-by-saulfabreg.35917/) and unzip it.
2. Copy your Megaman X2 ROM into the following folder: .../Devilken\_Injector/VC/ROM/
3. Copy your Donkey Kong Country 2 WAD into the following folder: .../Devilken\_Injector/VC/
4. Open the CMD by clicking on the address bar and typing 'cmd' and pressing Enter.
5. Type the following command in the CMD: VC.exe [wad\_name].wad ROM
Example: VC.exe DKC2\_SNES.wad ROM
6. Wait for the ROM to inject into the WAD. When the program asks you to enter the region, enter the region number and press Enter. The regions are shown on-screen.
7. When the program asks you to enter the new game ID, enter the game ID you want to assign to the injected WAD and press Enter. The instructions for entering new game ID are shown on-screen.
8. Wait for the program to finish the injection. When it shows 'Mission completed! =)', then close the CMD.
9. You will get a new title.wad file in the same folder as your original WAD. This is your injected WAD that contains Megaman X2.

## Method 2: AutoInjectuWAD Injector
 
AutoInjectuWAD Injector is a graphical tool that allows you to inject SNES ROMs into SNES WADs. It supports most SNES games, except those that use special chips, such as Super FX or SA-1. To use this method, follow these steps:

1. Download AutoInjectuWAD Injector from [here](https://gbatemp.net/download/all-in-one-wii-vc-injecting-tools-by-saulfabreg.35917/) and unzip it.
2. Run 'Auto Injectuwad Injector v3.exe' as administrator.
3. In 'Console Mode', select 'SNES' for Super NES injection.
4. In 'ROM File', browse for your Megaman X2 ROM.
5. In 'Base Wad', browse for your Donkey Kong Country 2 WAD.
6. In 'Output File 8cf37b1e13
