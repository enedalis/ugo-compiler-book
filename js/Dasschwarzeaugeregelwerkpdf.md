## Combat System
 
Another important and exciting part of playing Das Schwarze Auge is engaging in combat with various enemies and foes. The combat system in Das Schwarze Auge 5 is designed to be realistic and tactical, while still being fast and fun. The combat system follows a few basic steps:

1. Determine initiative: Each participant in the combat rolls a dice and adds their initiative modifier to determine their order of action. The higher the result, the earlier they act.
2. Take actions: Each participant in the combat can take one action per round. An action can be an attack, a defense, a movement or a special action. An attack is an attempt to harm an opponent with a weapon or a spell. A defense is an attempt to avoid or reduce an attack with a parry or a dodge. A movement is an attempt to change one's position or distance from an opponent. A special action is anything else that is not covered by the other actions, such as using an item or casting a spell.
3. Resolve actions: Each action is resolved by rolling dice and comparing them to the relevant attribute or skill value of the participant. If the result is equal to or lower than the value, the action succeeds. If the result is higher than the value, the action fails. The degree of success or failure is determined by how much the result differs from the value.
4. Apply effects: Each action has some effects that are applied to the participants involved in it. For example, an attack can cause damage or injury to an opponent. A defense can prevent or reduce damage or injury from an attack. A movement can change one's position or distance from an opponent. A special action can have various effects depending 8cf37b1e13
